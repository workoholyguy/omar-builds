description: "A high-performance distributed rate limiter for API protection using Redis and sliding window algorithm."
---

## Overview

A distributed rate limiting service designed to protect APIs from abuse while maintaining sub-millisecond latency. Uses Redis for coordination across multiple instances.

## Problem

Needed a rate limiting solution that could scale horizontally while maintaining consistency across distributed API servers. Commercial solutions were either too expensive or introduced unacceptable latency.

## Solution

Built a custom rate limiter in Go using the sliding window log algorithm. Redis provides distributed coordination with Lua scripts for atomic operations.

## My Contributions

- Implemented sliding window algorithm in Go
- Designed Redis Lua scripts for atomic rate limit checks
- Built Kubernetes deployment with horizontal auto-scaling
- Created monitoring with Prometheus metrics
- Wrote comprehensive test suite including chaos testing

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

**Challenge:** Maintaining accuracy during Redis failover.

**Solution:** Implemented local fallback with conservative limits during Redis unavailability, syncing state upon reconnection.
