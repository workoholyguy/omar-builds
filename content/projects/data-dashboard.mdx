## Overview

A high-performance analytics dashboard that transforms raw business data into actionable insights. Features interactive visualizations, real-time updates, and drill-down capabilities for exploring metrics.

## Problem

Business stakeholders needed a way to explore sales data across regions and time periods without waiting for manual report generation. Existing tools couldn't handle the data volume efficiently.

## Solution

Built a custom dashboard with optimized data pipelines and caching strategies. The frontend uses D3.js for custom visualizations that can render millions of data points smoothly.

## My Contributions

- Designed data aggregation pipeline with Python and PostgreSQL
- Implemented Redis caching layer for frequently accessed queries
- Built custom D3.js charts including choropleth maps and time series
- Created responsive layout with drill-down filtering
- Optimized frontend rendering for large datasets using virtualization

## Technical Details

The backend aggregates raw transaction data into pre-computed rollups at various time granularities. Redis caches these aggregations with intelligent invalidation on new data. The frontend uses React with D3.js for rendering, employing canvas for dense visualizations.

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

**Challenge:** Rendering 1M+ points without browser freezing.

**Solution:** Implemented data decimation and canvas-based rendering. Points aggregate at zoom levels below threshold.

**Tradeoff:** Chose pre-aggregation over real-time queries, accepting up to 5-minute data delay for significant performance gains.
