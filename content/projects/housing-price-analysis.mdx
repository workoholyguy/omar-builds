description: "Urban data science study analyzing how school quality and crime rates influence housing prices, achieving 95% F1-score with Random Forest models."

## Overview

A comprehensive urban analytics project analyzing the relationship between school quality, crime rates, and housing prices across Atlanta ZIP codes.

## Problem

Understanding what drives housing prices helps buyers make informed decisions and helps policymakers address inequities. This required integrating multiple data sources and building predictive models.

## Solution

Led a team project that combined housing, crime, and education datasets to identify key price drivers and build accurate prediction models.

## My Contributions

- Led a 6-person team through the complete data science lifecycle
- Integrated and cleaned 30K+ records from multiple sources
- Performed spatial analysis across Atlanta ZIP codes
- Built and tuned Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN models
- Achieved 95% F1-score for price-category prediction

## Dataset & Evaluation

**Dataset:** 30K+ records combining housing sales, crime statistics, and school quality metrics

**Evaluation:** Train/test split with cross-validation, F1-score, precision, recall

**Results:** Random Forest achieved 95% F1-score; identified price disparities up to 4.7× between neighborhoods

## Limitations

- Analysis limited to Atlanta metro area
- Historical data may not reflect current market conditions
- School quality metrics rely on standardized test scores

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

**Challenge:** Merging datasets with different geographic granularities (street addresses vs ZIP codes vs school districts).

**Solution:** Standardized to ZIP code level as the common denominator, accepting some loss of precision for data integration.
