description: "End-to-end analytics pipeline converting raw QuickBooks exports into geospatial and time-series analysis, deriving sales territories and revenue insights."

## Overview

A comprehensive data analytics project that transforms raw financial data into actionable business intelligence through geospatial clustering and time-series analysis.

## Problem

Raw QuickBooks exports contain valuable business data but require significant processing to extract insights about customer distribution, revenue patterns, and optimal sales territories.

## Solution

Built an end-to-end analytics pipeline that normalizes raw data, recovers customer locations, identifies sales territories, and analyzes seasonal revenue patterns.

## My Contributions

- Built complete data pipeline converting QuickBooks exports to normalized relational tables
- Implemented multi-stage geolocation resolution achieving 65% high-confidence coverage
- Validated clustering approach using Hopkins statistic
- Derived 6 operational sales territories capturing 75% of total revenue
- Performed seasonal decomposition to identify demand cycles

## Technical Details

Python with Pandas handles data wrangling and transformation. GeoPandas enables spatial analysis and visualization. Scikit-learn provides clustering algorithms. SQL manages the normalized relational structure.

## Dataset & Evaluation

**Dataset:** Real QuickBooks transaction exports with customer and invoice data

**Evaluation:** Hopkins statistic for cluster tendency, silhouette scores for cluster quality

**Results:** 6 distinct territories, one region accounting for ~75% of revenue

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

**Challenge:** Many customer records lacked explicit geolocation data.

**Solution:** Implemented multi-stage resolution using address parsing, zip code lookups, and city-level approximations, achieving 65% high-confidence coverage.
