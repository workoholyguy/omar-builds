## Overview

A modern task management application featuring kanban boards, real-time collaboration, and offline support. Built as a Progressive Web App for cross-device compatibility.

## Problem

Needed a lightweight alternative to complex project management tools for small teams. Focus on core functionality: organizing tasks, tracking progress, and syncing across devices.

## Solution

Built a streamlined task manager with drag-and-drop boards, real-time updates, and PWA capabilities. Firebase handles authentication and real-time database sync.

## My Contributions

- Implemented drag-and-drop kanban interface with smooth animations
- Built real-time sync with Firebase Realtime Database
- Created offline-first architecture with service workers
- Designed responsive UI that works on mobile and desktop
- Added keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

**Challenge:** Handling conflicts when multiple users edit the same task offline.

**Solution:** Implemented last-write-wins with visual indicators showing sync status and conflict history.
