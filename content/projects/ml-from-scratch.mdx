## Overview

A deep-dive into machine learning fundamentals by implementing core algorithms from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on ML frameworks.

## Problem

Understanding ML algorithms at a surface level limits ability to debug, tune, and adapt models. Building from scratch provides fundamental understanding of how these algorithms actually work.

## Solution

Implemented complete ML pipelines from first principles, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## My Contributions

- Implemented KNN classifier with custom distance metrics
- Built logistic regression with gradient descent optimization
- Developed neural networks with backpropagation from scratch
- Created manual cross-validation and regularization
- Produced reproducible experiments with evaluation artifacts

## Technical Details

Pure NumPy implementation without sklearn for model training. Focused on numerical stability, proper gradient computation, and interpretable code structure.

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

**Challenge:** Numerical instability in softmax and log-likelihood computations.

**Solution:** Implemented log-sum-exp trick and careful numerical handling to prevent overflow/underflow while maintaining accuracy.
