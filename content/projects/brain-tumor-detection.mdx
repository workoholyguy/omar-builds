## Overview

A machine learning pipeline for detecting brain tumors in medical imaging using YOLOv8 object detection, with emphasis on reproducibility and proper problem framing.

## Problem

Medical imaging datasets often have annotation issues. The original dataset was labeled for semantic segmentation but contained rectangular annotation artifacts that made it unsuitable for that task.

## Solution

Diagnosed the dataset-label mismatch and reframed the task from semantic segmentation to object detection (bounding boxes), which better matched the actual annotation structure.

## My Contributions

- Identified dataset annotation issues and correctly reframed the ML problem
- Built fully reproducible training and inference pipeline
- Developed COCO↔YOLO format converters for data preprocessing
- Created evaluation scripts and visual diagnostics
- Trained YOLOv8 model on Apple Silicon (MPS backend)

## Dataset & Evaluation

**Dataset:** Medical brain MRI scans with tumor annotations

**Evaluation:** Standard object detection metrics including mAP@50, IoU, and pixel accuracy

**Results:** mAP@50 = 0.905, mean IoU = 0.73, pixel accuracy = 0.91

## Limitations

- Model trained on specific MRI scan types; may not generalize to different imaging protocols
- Requires careful preprocessing for new data
- Bounding box detection doesn't provide precise tumor boundaries

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

**Challenge:** Original semantic segmentation approach produced poor results due to annotation artifacts.

**Solution:** Recognized that rectangular annotations were better suited for object detection; switched to YOLOv8 bounding box approach, dramatically improving results.
