## Overview

HandyHub is a community-driven Q&A platform that enables users to ask questions, provide answers, and engage in discussions with voting and reward mechanisms.

## Problem

Online communities often struggle with content quality and user engagement. Poor ranking systems and lack of incentives lead to low-quality responses and decreased participation.

## Solution

Built a platform with authentication, voting logic, and a rewards system that incentivizes quality contributions and surfaces the best content.

## My Contributions

- Built complete Q&A platform with authentication and private routes
- Implemented voting, rewards, and threaded discussion features
- Created search, sorting, and filtering with responsive UI patterns
- Handled Supabase auth flows, session persistence, and relational data modeling
- Designed database schema for posts, answers, and user profiles

## Technical Details

React with TypeScript provides type-safe frontend development. Supabase handles authentication, real-time subscriptions, and PostgreSQL database. Tailwind CSS enables rapid, consistent styling.

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

**Challenge:** Implementing real-time vote counts without excessive database queries.

**Solution:** Used Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates while caching vote counts locally to reduce reads.
