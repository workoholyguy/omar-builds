## Overview

A modern e-commerce platform built from the ground up with Next.js and PostgreSQL. Features a complete shopping experience with cart management, secure Stripe checkout, and a comprehensive admin dashboard for inventory management.

## Problem

Small businesses need affordable e-commerce solutions that don't sacrifice performance or user experience. Existing platforms often come with high transaction fees or limited customization options.

## Solution

Built a custom e-commerce platform that prioritizes speed, security, and ease of use. The platform handles the complete purchase flow from browsing to checkout, with real-time inventory updates and order tracking.

## My Contributions

- Designed and implemented the complete frontend with Next.js App Router
- Built RESTful API endpoints for products, orders, and user management
- Integrated Stripe for secure payment processing
- Created admin dashboard with real-time analytics
- Implemented optimistic UI updates for cart operations

## Technical Details

The application uses Next.js 14 with the App Router for server-side rendering and API routes. PostgreSQL handles data persistence with Prisma as the ORM. Stripe Elements provides the payment UI with webhook integration for order confirmation.

## Challenges & Tradeoffs

**Challenge:** Handling concurrent inventory updates during high-traffic periods.

**Solution:** Implemented optimistic locking with database transactions to prevent overselling while maintaining fast response times.

**Tradeoff:** Chose server-side cart storage over local storage for better security, accepting slightly higher latency on cart operations.
